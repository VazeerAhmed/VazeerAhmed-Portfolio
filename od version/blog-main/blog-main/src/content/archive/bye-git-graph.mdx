**Takeaway:** With the new VSCode 1.93 update, you can now view your Git collaboration graph directly in Source Control.

I am a very heavy user of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and I use it for almost all my coding and writing tasks. One of my favorite extensions was the [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph) extension, which allowed me to visualize my Git collaboration graph. However, with the recent [VSCode 1.93 update](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93), this feature has been integrated into VSCode's Source Control, making the Git Graph extension redundant.

Let's check out this new feature together!

In the past, we had to open Git Graph to see our project's collaboration graph, like this:

However, even in the older [VSCode 1.92 version](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_92), I noticed that VSCode started adding Git Graph into the program itself. At first, you could only see the graph when you were pushing changes. But now, with [VSCode 1.93](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93), you can see the Git Graph directly in Source Control, like this:

This is super helpful because you don't need an extra tool to check the graph. Now, I can see all the files I've changed and the commits my team has made in one place. If you click on a commit, you can even see what was changed:

That's it! Now you can easily check your Git collaboration graph without needing the Git Graph extension.
