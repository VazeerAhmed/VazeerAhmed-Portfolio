**Takeaway:** Go to settings and uncheck **"Compact Folders"**

Have you ever been annoyed by VSCode's default folder view? For example, when you have a nested structure like `folder/folder/`, and you're always clicking on the wrong folder inside another folder. It gets even worse when you try to drag a file into a new folder — you often end up dropping it in the wrong place.

That's why I'm writing this post — to share a **one-step fix** to prevent this situation while you're developing.

## Before

Take a look at the example below. The file `views/route.ts` is under the `api` folder. But VSCode shows it as `api/views/` in a single line. It's hard to click accurately

Now imagine if your folder structure goes even deeper, like this:

```plaintext
app/(admin)/(dashboard)/api/v1/views/manage/
│   ├── first.ts
```

That's totally a nightmare right? When you try to drag `first.ts` into any other folder, you might end up dropping it in the wrong place.

## After

Open **Settings**, search for **"Compact Folders"**, and simply **uncheck** it.

You'll immediately see a more friendly and readable folder structure.

Now that same `api/views/route.ts` example becomes:

```plaintext
api/
├── views/
│   ├── route.ts
```

That's it! Enjoy your smooth developing experience by just one small setting change. Happy coding!
